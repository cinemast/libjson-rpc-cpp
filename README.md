libjson-rpc-cpp
===============

This framework provides cross platform JSON-RPC (remote procedure call) support for C++.
It is fully JSON-RPC [2.0 & 1.0 compatible](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

![libjson-rpc-cpp logo](https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp/blob/master/dev/artwork/logo.png?raw=true)

**5 good reasons for using libjson-rpc-cpp in your next RPC project**
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 & 1.0 Client and Server Support.
- jsonrpcstub - a tool that generates stub-classes for your JSON-RPC client AND server applications.
- Ready to use HTTP + TCP server and client to provide simple interfaces for your JSON-RPC application.
- Cross platform build support and [precompiled binaries for WIN32](http://spiessknafl.at/libjson-rpc-cpp).
- Super liberal [MIT-License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). 

**Other good reasons to use libjson-rpc-cpp**
- Easy to use [cmake](http://www.cmake.org) cross platform build system.
- Clean and simple architecture, which makes it easy to extend.
- Tested under MacOS X (10.9), GNU/Linux (Debian 8 64-bit), Windows 7 (MinGW32) and Raspbian Wheezy (armhf).
- Automated testing using `make test`.
- Useful Examples provided. e.g. XBMC Remote using json-rpc client part and stub generator.
- The stubgenerator currently supports C++ and JavaScript.

Overview
=========

Install the framework
=====================

**Debian (stretch) and Ubuntu (15.10 or later)**

```sh
sudo apt-get install libjsonrpccpp-dev libjsonrpccpp-tools
```

**Arch Linux**

For Arch Linux there is a [PKGBUILD provided in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libjson-rpc-cpp/).

```sh
sudo aura -A libjson-rpc-cpp
```

**Gentoo Linux**

```sh
sudo emerge dev-cpp/libjson-rpc-cpp
```

**Mac OS X**

For OS X a [Brew](http://brew.sh) package is available:
```sh
brew install libjson-rpc-cpp
```

**Windows**

There is a ready to use compiled package [here](http://spiessknafl.at/libjson-rpc-cpp).
Just download execute the installer EXE.

Build from source
=================
Install the dependencies
------------------------
- [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
- [libmicrohttpd](http://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)
- [libjsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)
- [libargtable](http://argtable.sourceforge.net/)
- [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/)

**UNIX**

For Debian and Arch GNU/Linux based systems, all dependencies are available via the package manager.
For OS X all dependencies are available in [Brew](http://brew.sh)

**Windows**

- Download the precompiled dependencies form [here](https://spiessknafl.at/libjson-rpc-cpp/libjson-rpc-cpp_win32-deps.zip).
- Extract it into the cloned repository, so that there is a `win32-deps` folder in the root project directory.

Build
-----

```sh
git clone git://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp.git
mkdir -p libjson-rpc-cpp/build
cd libjson-rpc-cpp/build
cmake .. && make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig          #only required for linux
```
That's it!

If you are not happy with it, simply uninstall it from your system using (inside the build the directory):
```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

**Build options:**

Default configuration should be fine for most systems, but here are available compilation flags:

- `-DCOMPILE_TESTS=NO` disables unit test suite.
- `-DCOMPILE_STUBGEN=NO` disables building the stubgenerator.
- `-DCOMPILE_EXAMPLES=NO` disables examples.
- `-DHTTP_SERVER=NO` disable the libmicrohttpd webserver.
- `-DHTTP_CLIENT=NO` disable the curl client.
- `-DUNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_SERVER=NO` disable the unix domain socket server connector.
- `-DUNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_CLIENT=NO` disable the unix domain socket client connector.
- `-DFILE_DESCRIPTOR_SERVER=NO` disable the file descriptor server connector.
- `-DFILE_DESCRIPTOR_CLIENT=NO` disable the file descriptor client connector.
- `-DTCP_SOCKET_SERVER=NO` disable the tcp socket server connector.
- `-DTCP_SOCKET_CLIENT=NO` disable the tcp socket client connector.

Using the framework
===================
This example will show the most simple way to create a rpc server and client. If you only need the server, ignore step 4. If you only need the client, ignore step 3. You can find all resources of this sample in the `src/examples` directory of this repository.

### Step 1: Writing the specification file ###

```json
[
	{
		"name": "sayHello",
		"params": { 
			"name": "Peter"
		},
		"returns" : "Hello Peter"
	},
	{
		"name" : "notifyServer"
	}
]
```

The type of a return value or parameter is defined by the literal assigned to it. In this example you can see how to specify methods and notifications.

### Step 2: Generate the stubs for client and server ###

Call jsonrpcstub:
```sh
jsonrpcstub spec.json --cpp-server=AbstractStubServer --cpp-client=StubClient
```

This generates a serverstub and a clientstub class.


### Step 3: implement the abstract server stub ###

Extend the abstract server stub and implement all pure virtual (abstract) methods defined in `spec.json`.

```cpp
#include "abstractstubserver.h"
#include <jsonrpccpp/server/connectors/httpserver.h>

using namespace jsonrpc;
using namespace std;

class MyStubServer : public AbstractStubServer
{
    public:
        MyStubServer(AbstractServerConnector &connector);

        virtual void notifyServer();
        virtual std::string sayHello(const std::string& name);
};

MyStubServer::MyStubServer(AbstractServerConnector &connector) :
    AbstractStubServer(connector)
{
}
void MyStubServer::notifyServer()
{
    cout << "Server got notified" << endl;
}
string MyStubServer::sayHello(const string &name)
{
    return "Hello " + name;
}

int main()
{
    HttpServer httpserver(8383);
    MyStubServer s(httpserver);
    s.StartListening();
    getchar();
    s.StopListening();
    return 0;
}
```

In the main function the concrete server is instantiated and started. That is all for the server. Any JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant client can now connect to your server.

Compile the server with:

```sh
g++ main.cpp -ljsoncpp -lmicrohttpd -ljsonrpccpp-common -ljsonrpccpp-server -o sampleserver
```

### Step 4: Create the client application
```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include "stubclient.h"
#include <jsonrpccpp/client/connectors/httpclient.h>

using namespace jsonrpc;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    HttpClient httpclient("http://localhost:8383");
    StubClient c(httpclient);
    try
    {
        cout << c.sayHello("Peter") << endl;
        c.notifyServer();
    }
    catch (JsonRpcException e)
    {
        cerr << e.what() << endl;
    }
}
```

Compile the client with:

```sh
g++ main.cpp -ljsoncpp -lcurl -ljsonrpccpp-common -ljsonrpccpp-client -o sampleclient
```
