	pipe when using MHD_USE_EPOLL_LINUX_ONLY (#3751). -MH/CG

Tue Mar 31 10:28:26 CEST 2015
	Adding MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_CONNECTION,
	MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_STARTED,
	MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_CLOSED and
	MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT to allow

	Fixing bug that prevented MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_DHPARAMS
	from working within a MHD_OPTION_ARRAY. -DD

	mode if there is a client with open connections.
	Thanks to Kenneth Mastro for reporting. -CG

Sun Jun 22 12:22:08 CEST 2014
	Actually, avoid locking on response as responses must
	not be modified in a connection-specific way; instead
	modify the connection's data buffer to add missing
	responses headers.  If we are forced to add
	"Connection: close", suppress output of conflicting
	application-provided "Connection: Keep-Alive" header. -CG

Sun Jun 22 00:22:08 CEST 2014
	Lock on response if adding headers, needed if response
	object is shared across threads and connections. -CG

Thu Jun 19 17:32:32 CEST 2014
	Ensure that listen FD is bound to epoll FD even before

Sun Jun  8 15:10:44 CEST 2014
	Add 'MHD_set_response_options' as a way to set per-response
	flags.  Add flag to force HTTP 1.0-only conservative
	behavior, in particular suppressing adding "Connection"
	headers. -CG

Mon Jun  2 00:03:28 CEST 2014
	Added back unescaping for URI path (#3413) but without
	unescaping '+' (#3371) to remain compatible with
	MHD 0.9.34 and before.  Note that applications providing
	a custom MHD_OPTION_UNESCAPE_CALLBACK are no longer expected
	to replace '+' with ' ', as that is now done separately for
	the locations where this transformation is appropriate.
	Releasing 0.9.37. -CG

Wed May 28 15:30:56 CEST 2014
	Properly applying patch that was supposed to be

	Releasing 0.9.35. -CG

Thu Apr 10 09:39:38 CEST 2014
	Removed unescaping for URI path (#3371) as '+' should not
	be converted to space in accordance with
	http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#ampersands-in-uris
	and http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1
	Note that we now also no longer convert '#38;' to '&'; if needed,
	the application needs to apply unescaping to the path of the URI
	itself (before, MHD unescaped '#38;' but not '&amp;', so this
	inconsistency was now resolved by simply not unescaping anything
	before the first '&'). -CG

Tue Apr 08 15:35:44 CET 2014
	Added support for W32 native threads.
	Added --with-threads=LIB configure parameter. -EG

Tue Feb 18 19:46:45 CET 2014
	Removed dependency on plibc for simpler compilation for W32.
	Added configure option "--disable-pipes" to use socketpairs
	instead of pipes for signalling to child threads. Pipes are
	always disabled on W32.
	Some code refactoring. -EG

Sat Feb  8 15:08:35 CET 2014
	Corrected some uses of 'int' vs. 'size_t'. -EG/CG

Wed Jan 22 09:44:33 CET 2014
	MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK in libmicrohttpd currently just *inhibits
	setting* the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option, but per Microsoft's
	documentation the default on Windows is that this is enabled, thus
	MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK will not work (since it leaves the
	default). libmicrohttpd should probably just unconditionally set
	IPV6_V6ONLY to the desired value when the option is available. -LJ

Wed Jan  1 21:38:18 CET 2014
	Allow Keep-Alive with HTTP 1.0 (if explicitly requested),

	Releasing 0.9.32. -CG

Tue Dec  3 21:05:38 CET 2013
	Signaling n times for shutdown works, but for resume we need to
	wake up the correct daemon. Even if we signal n times in that
	case also, there's no guarantee that some daemon can't run
	through its select loop more than once before the daemon we want
	to wake up gets a chance to read.  Thus we need a signal pipe
	per thread in the thread pool IF MHD_suspend_connection is used.
	This introduces a new flag MHD_USE_SUSPEND_RESUME to add those
	additional pipes and only allow MHD_suspend_connection to be
	used in conjunction with this flag.

	Also, as MHD_resume_connection() will be called on a non-daemon
	thread, but none of the queue insert/delete calls are thread safe,
	we need to be concerned about (a) corrupting the queue, and (b)
	having to add mutex protection around every access to the queues,
	including loops through timer queues, etc. This wasn't a problem
	before adding resume; even suspend should be safe since it happens
	in a callback from the daemon.

	I think it's easier to (a) have MHD_suspend_connection() move the
	connection to a suspended queue, (b) have MHD_resume_connection()
	mark the connection as resuming, and then (c) do all the actual
	queue manipulations in MHD_select (poll, epoll, etc.) to move the
	resumed connections back to their normal queues, in response to
	the wake up. The changes are simpler & cleaner. There is a cost to
	the basic select loop that is avoided by making suspend/resume a
	startup option. The per-worker pipes can then also be enabled only
	with that option set. -MH

Fri Nov 29 20:17:03 CET 2013
	Eliminating theoretical stack overflow by limiting length
	of URIs in authentication headers to 32k (only applicable
	if the application explicitly raised the memroy limits,

	Signal connection termination as OK (and not as ERROR) if the
	stream was terminated by the callback returning
	MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM. Also, release response
	mutex before calling the termination callback, to avoid
	possible deadlock if the client destroys the response in
	the termination callback (due to non-recursiveness of the
	lock). -CG

Wed Sep 18 14:31:35 CEST 2013

Sat Aug 10 17:31:31 CEST 2013
	Disable use of 'shutdown' on W32 always as winsock

	to specify a custom value for incrementing read buffer
	sizes (#2899). -MH

Fri Jun 28 14:05:15 CEST 2013
	If we shutdown connection for reading on POST due to error,
	really do not process further requests even if we already
	read the next request from the connection.  Furthermore, do
	not shutdown connections for reading on GET/HEAD/etc. just
	because	the application queued a response immediately ---
	reserve that behavior for PUT/POST. -CG

Tue Jun 25 15:08:30 CEST 2013
	Added option 'MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK' to support a single
	daemon for IPv4 and IPv6 without the application having
	to do the binding. -CG

Mon Jun 24 22:33:34 CEST 2013
	Finished integration with epoll, including benchmarking and
	documentation. -CG

Sun Jun 23 15:28:13 CEST 2013
	Added option 'MHD_USE_PIPE_FOR_SHUTDOWN' to cleanly support
	'MHD_quiesce_daemon' with thread pools and per-connection
	threads (we then need a pipe for shutdown, but if
	'MHD_quiesce_daemon' is not used, we do not want to
	require the use of a pipe; introducing the pipe after
	the threads have been started can also fail, so the
	application needs to tell us early on). -CG

Sat Jun 22 20:24:17 CEST 2013
	Removed locking calls for thread modes that do not need them.
	Reorganized way to obtain connection's event loop state.
	Added sorted XDLL for connections with default timeout to
	avoid having to loop over all connections to determine current
	timeout (custom per-connection timeouts are in another list
	which is iterated each time). -CG

Fri Jun 21 20:55:48 CEST 2013

	Added MHD demonstration code 'src/examples/demo.c'. -CG

Sun Mar 31 20:27:48 CEST 2013
	Adding new API call 'MHD_run_from_select' to allow programs
	running in 'external select mode' to reduce the number of
	'select' calls by a factor of two. -CG

Sun Mar 31 20:03:48 CEST 2013
	Performance improvements, updated documentation.
	Make better use of available memory pool memory for
	reading (especially important for large POST uploads);
	improve post processor speed by internally adjusting the
	buffer size by 4 bytes to ensure "round" IO sizes given
	a "round" post processor buffer size argument.  Note
	that applications that previously added 4 bytes to the
	post processor buffer size might now perform worse.
	Using the new 'demo' example, POST upload speed
	increased from ~90 MB/s to ~120 MB/s for a large file
	(note that the improvement comes from better aligned
	disk IO; without disk IO, the speed was (and remains)
	at ~1500 MB/s on this system). -CG

Thu Dec  6 10:14:44 CET 2012
	Force adding "Connection: close" header to response if
	client asked for connection to be closed (so far, we
	did close the connection, but did not send the
	"Connection: close" header explicitly, which some clients
	seem to dislike. (See discussion on mailinglist).
	Also, if there is already a transfer-encoding other
	than 'chunked' set by the application, we also now close
	the connection if the response is of unknown size. -CG

	possible. -CG

Tue Aug 21 14:36:17 CEST 2012
	Use "int" instead of "enum X" in 'va_arg' calls to be nice to
	compilers that use 'short' (i.e. 8 or 16 bit) enums but pass
	enums still as "int" in varargs. (See discussion on mailinglist). -CG/MV

Tue Aug 21 14:31:54 CEST 2012

	(we already used non-blocking sockets for GNU/Linux); also
	use non-blocking sockets on Cygwin for HTTPS as this is

Sun Feb 13 10:52:29 CET 2011
	Handle gnutls receive error(s) for interrupted SSL
	connections better. -MS

Fri Jan 14 19:19:45 CET 2011
	Removing dead code, adding missing new symbols to export list.
	Fixed two missing NULL checks after malloc operations. -CG

Thu Nov 18 22:55:58 CET 2010
	Fixing #1621 (socket not closed under certain circumstances). -CG/jaredc

Wed Nov 17 12:16:53 CET 2010
	Allowing signalling of errors in generating chunked responses to
	clients (by closing connectins) using the new
	MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR ((size_t)-2) return value.  Also
	introducing MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM constant instead

	Adding API call to generate HTTP footers in response. -CG

Sat Oct 16 12:38:43 CEST 2010
	Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.9.2. -CG

Tue Oct 12 15:41:51 CEST 2010
	Fixed issue with data received via SSL being delayed in the
	GNUtls buffer if sender stopped transmitting (but did not close
	the connection) and MHD buffer size was smaller than last fragment,
	resulting in possibly significantly delayed processing of
	incoming data.  -CG

Wed Sep 22 09:48:59 CEST 2010
	Changed port argument from 'unsigned short' to 'uint16_t'.
	Removed dead code when compiling with messages enabled.

Sat Sep  4 21:55:52 CEST 2010
	Digest authentication now seems to be working. -CG/AA

Wed Sep  1 13:59:16 CEST 2010
	Added ability to specify external unescape function.
	"microhttpd.h" now includes the right headers for GNU/Linux
	systems unless MHD_PLATFORM_H is defined (in which case it
	is assumed that the right headers were already determined by
	some configure-like process). -CG

Tue Aug 31 15:39:25 CEST 2010
	Fixed bug with missing call to response cleanup in case of
	connection handling error (for example, after getting a SIGPIPE). -CG

Tue Aug 24 11:39:25 CEST 2010
	Fixed bug in handling EAGAIN from GnuTLS (caused
	needlessly dropped SSL connections). -CG

Sun Aug 22 16:49:13 CEST 2010
	Initial draft for digest authentication. -AA

Thu Aug 19 14:15:01 CEST 2010
	Changed code to enable error messages and HTTPS by default;
	added option to disable post processor API (use
	breaks binary compatibility, should only be done
	for embedded systems that require minimal footprint). -CG

Thu Aug 19 13:26:00 CEST 2010
	Patches for Windows to ease compilation trouble. -GT/CG

	Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.9.0. -CG

Sun Jul 25 14:57:47 CEST 2010
	Adding support for sendfile on Linux.  Adding support
	for systemd-style passing of an existing listen socket
	as an option.  IPv6 sockets now only bind to IPv6
	(if platform supports this). -CG

Sun Jul 25 11:10:45 CEST 2010

	which fixes SSL support on big endian architectures. -JA/CG

Sat Feb 20 10:01:09 CET 2010

	fatal errors (previously, the implementation always
	called 'abort' in these cases). -CG/ND

Wed Nov 11 12:54:16 CET 2009
	Adding support for poll (alternative to select allowing
	for more than FD_SETSIZE parallel connections). -JM

Wed Oct 28 20:26:00 CET 2009
 	Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.4. -CG

Wed Oct 14 14:37:37 CEST 2009
	Fixing (rare) deadlock due to SELECT missing SIGALRM by
	making all SELECT calls block for at most 1s.  While this
	can in (rare) situations delay the shutdown by 1s, I think
	this is preferable (both performance and possibly portability-wise)
	over using a pipe for the signal. -CG

Sun Oct 11 14:57:29 CEST 2009
	Adding eCos license as an additional license for the
	non-HTTPS code of MHD. -CG

Sun Oct 11 11:24:27 CEST 2009
	Adding support for Symbian. -MR

Fri Oct  9 15:21:29 CEST 2009
	Check for error codes from pthread operations (to help with
	error diagnostics) and abort if something went wrong. -CG

Thu Oct  8 10:43:02 CEST 2009
	Added check for sockets being '< FD_SETSIZE' (just to be safe). -CG

Mon Oct  5 21:17:26 CEST 2009
	Adding "COOKIE" header string #defines. -CG

Mon Oct  5 08:29:06 CEST 2009

Sun Aug 23 16:21:35 UTC 2009
	Allow MHD_get_daemon_info to return the daemon's listen socket.
	Includes a test case that uses this functionality to bind a server to
	an OS-assigned port, look the port up with getsockname, and curl it. -DR

Tue Aug  4 00:14:04 CEST 2009
	 Fixing double-call to read from content-reader callback for first
	 data segment (as reported by Alex on the mailinglist). -CG

Thu Jul 29 21:41:52 CEST 2009
 	 Fixed issue with the code not using the "block_size" argument
         given to MHD_create_response_from_callback causing inefficiencies
	 for values < 2048 and segmentation faults for values > 2048
	 (as reported by Andre Colomb on the mailinglist). -CG

Sun May 17 03:29:46 MDT 2009
 	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.2. -CG

Fri May 15 11:00:20 MDT 2009
	 Grow reserved read buffer more aggressively so that we are not
	 needlessly stuck reading only a handfull of bytes in each iteration. -CG

Thu May 14 21:20:30 MDT 2009
	 Fixed issue where the "NOTIFY_COMPLETED" handler could be called
	 twice (if a socket error or timeout occured for a pipelined
	 connection after successfully completing a request and before
	 the next request was successfully transmitted).  This could
	 confuse applications not expecting to see a connection "complete"
	 that they were never aware of in the first place. -CG

Mon May 11 13:01:16 MDT 2009
         Fixed issue where error code on timeout was "TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR"
         instead of "TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED". -CG

Wed Apr  1 21:33:05 CEST 2009
         Added MHD_get_version(). -ND

Wed Mar 18 22:59:07 MDT 2009
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.1. -CG

Wed Mar 18 17:46:58 MDT 2009
	 Always RECV/SEND with MSG_DONTWAIT to (possibly) address
	 strange deadlock reported by Erik on the mailinglist ---
	 and/or issues with blocking read after select on GNU/Linux
	 (see select man page under bugs). -CG

Tue Mar 17 01:19:50 MDT 2009
	 Added support for thread-pools. -CG/RA

Mon Mar  2 23:44:08 MST 2009
	 Fixed problem with 64-bit upload and download sizes and
	 "-1" being used to indicate "unknown" by introducing
	 new 64-bit constant "MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN". -CG/DC

Wed Feb 18 08:13:56 MST 2009
	 Added missing #include for build on arm-linux-uclibc. -CG/CC

Mon Feb 16 21:12:21 MST 2009

	 even if HTTPS support is not enabled. -CG

Sun Feb  8 21:15:30 MST 2009
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.0. -CG

Thu Feb  5 22:43:45 MST 2009
	 Incompatible API change to allow 64-bit uploads and downloads.
	 Clients must use "uint64_t" for the "pos"
	 argument (MHD_ContentReaderCallback) and the "off"
	 argument (MHD_PostDataIterator) and the "size"
	 argument (MHD_create_response_from_callback) now.
	 Also, "unsigned int" was changed to "size_t" for
	 the "upload_data_size" argument (MHD_AccessHandlerCallback),
	 the argument to MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT,
	 the "block_size" argument (MHD_create_response_from_callback),
	 the "buffer_size" argument (MHD_create_post_processor) and
	 the "post_data_len" argument (MHD_post_process).  You may
	 need to #include <stdint.h> before <microhttpd.h> from now on. -CG

Thu Feb  5 20:21:08 MST 2009
	 Allow getting address information about the connecting
	 client after the accept call. -CG

Mon Feb  2 22:21:48 MST 2009
	 Fixed missing size adjustment for offsets for %-encoded
	 arguments processed by the post processor (Mantis #1447). -CG/SN

Fri Jan 23 16:57:21 MST 2009
	 Support charset specification (ignore) after content-type
	 when post-processing HTTP POST requests (Mantis #1443). -CG/SN

Fri Dec 26 23:08:04 MST 2008
	 Fixed broken check for identical connection address. -CG
	 Making cookie parser more RFC2109 compliant (handle
	 spaces around key, allow value to be optional). -CG

Sat Dec  6 18:36:17 MST 2008
	 Added configure option to disable checking for CURL support.
	 Added MHD_OPTION to allow specification of custom logger. -CG

Tue Nov 18 01:19:53 MST 2008
	 Removed support for untested and/or broken SSL features
	 and (largely useless) options. -CG

Sun Nov 16 16:54:54 MST 2008
	 Added option to get unparsed URI via callback.
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.4.0pre1. -CG

Sun Nov 16 02:48:14 MST 2008
	 Removed tons of dead code. -CG

Sat Nov 15 17:34:24 MST 2008
	 Added build support for code coverage analysis. -CG

Sat Nov 15 00:31:33 MST 2008
	 Removing (broken) support for HTTPS servers with
	 anonymous (aka "no") certificates as well as
	 various useless dead code. -CG

Sat Nov  8 02:18:42 MST 2008
	 Unset TCP_CORK at the end of transmitting a response
	 to improve performance (on systems where this is
	 supported). -MM

Tue Sep 30 16:48:08 MDT 2008
	 Make MHD useful to Cygwin users; detect IPv6 headers
	 in configure.

Sun Sep 28 14:57:46 MDT 2008
	 Unescape URIs (convert "%ef%e4%45" to "$BCf9q(B"). -CG

Wed Sep 10 22:43:59 MDT 2008
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.4.0pre0. -CG

Wed Sep 10 21:36:06 MDT 2008
	 Fixed data race on closing sockets during
	 shutdown (in one-thread-per-connection mode). -CG

Thu Sep  4 23:37:18 MDT 2008
	 Fixed some boundary issues with processing
	 chunked requests; removed memmove from a
	 number of spots, in favor of using an index into
	 the current buffer instead. -GS

Sun Aug 24 13:05:41 MDT 2008
	 Now handling clients returning 0 from response callback
	 as specified in the documentation (abort if internal
	 select is used, retry immediately if a thread per
	 connection is used). -CG

Sun Aug 24 12:44:43 MDT 2008
	 Added missing reason phrase. -SG

Sun Aug 24 10:33:22 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bug where MHD failed to transmit the response when
	 the client decided not to send "100 CONTINUE" during
	 a PUT/POST request. -CG

Wed Jul 16 18:54:03 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bug generating chunked responses with chunk sizes
	 greater than 0xFFFFFF (would cause protocol violations). -CG

Mon May 26 13:28:57 MDT 2008
	 Updated and improved documentation.
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.3.1. -CG

Fri May 23 16:54:41 MDT 2008
	 Fixed issue with postprocessor not handling URI-encoded
	 values of more than 1024 bytes correctly. -CG

Mon May  5 09:18:29 MDT 2008
	 Fixed date header (was off by 1900 years). -JP

Sun Apr 13 01:06:20 MDT 2008
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.3.0. -CG

Sat Apr 12 21:34:26 MDT 2008
	 Generate an internal server error if the programmer fails
	 to handle upload data correctly.  Tweaked testcases to
	 avoid running into the problem in the testcases.
	 Completed zzuf-based fuzzing testcases.  -CG

Sat Apr 12 15:14:05 MDT 2008
	 Restructured the code (curl-testcases and zzuf testcases
	 are now in different directories; code examples are in
	 src/examples/).
	 Fixed a problem (introduced in 0.2.3) with handling very
	 large requests (the code did not return proper error code).
	 If "--enable-messages" is specified, the code now includes
	 reasonable default HTML webpages for various build-in
	 errors (such as request too large and malformed requests).
	 Without that flag, the webpages returned will still be
	 empty.
	 Started to add zzuf-based fuzzing-testcases (these require
	 the zzuf and socat binaries to be installed). -CG

Fri Apr 11 20:20:34 MDT 2008
	 I hereby dub libmicrohttpd a GNU package. -Richard Stallman

Sat Mar 29 22:36:09 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bugs in handling of malformed HTTP requests
	 (causing either NULL dereferences or connections to
	 persist until time-out, if any). -CG

	 Updated and integrated TexInfo documentation. -CG

Tue Mar 25 13:40:53 MDT 2008
	 Prevent multi-part post-processor from going to error
	 state when the input buffer is full and current token
	 just changes processor state without consuming any data.
	 Also, the original implementation would not consume any
	 input in process_value_to_boundary if there is no new
	 line character in sight. -AS

	 Remove checks for request method after it finished writing
	 response footers as it's only _pipelined_ requests that
	 should not be allowed after POST or PUT requests.  Reusing
	 the existing connection is perfectly ok though.  And there
	 is no reliable way to detect pipelining on server side
	 anyway so it is the client's responsibility to not send new
	 data before it gets a response after a POST operation. -AS

	 Clarified license in man page. Releasing
         libmicrohttpd 0.2.3 -CG

Sat Mar 22 01:12:38 MDT 2008
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.2. -CG

Mon Feb 25 19:13:53 MST 2008
	 Fixed a problem with sockets closed for reading ending up
	 in the read set under certain circumstances. -CG

Wed Jan 30 23:15:44 MST 2008
	 Added support for nested multiparts to post processor.
	 Made sure that MHD does not allow pipelining for methods
	 other than HEAD and GET (and of course still also only
	 allows it for http 1.1).  Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.1.  -CG

Mon Jan 21 11:59:46 MST 2008
	 Added option to limit number of concurrent connections
	 accepted from the same IP address. -CG

Fri Jan  4 16:02:08 MST 2008
	 Fix to properly close connection if application signals
	 problem handling the request. - AS

Wed Jan  2 16:41:05 MST 2008
	 Improvements and bugfixes to post processor implementation. - AS

Wed Dec 19 21:12:04 MST 2007
	 Implemented chunked (HTTP 1.1) downloads (including
	 sending of HTTP footers).  Also allowed queuing of
	 a response early to suppress the otherwise automatic
	 "100 CONTINUE" response.  Removed the mostly useless
	 "(un)register handler" methods from the API.  Changed
	 the internal implementation to use a finite state
	 machine (cleaner code, slightly less memory consumption).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.0. - CG

Sun Dec 16 03:24:13 MST 2007
	 Implemented handling of chunked (HTTP 1.1) uploads.
	 Note that the upload callback must be able to
	 process chunks in the size uploaded by the client,
	 MHD will not "join" small chunks into a big
	 contiguous block of memory (even if buffer space
	 would be available).  - CG

Wed Dec  5 21:39:35 MST 2007
	 Fixed race in multi-threaded server mode.
	 Fixed handling of POST data when receiving a
	 "Connection: close" header (#1296).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.2. - CG

Sat Nov 17 00:55:24 MST 2007
	 Fixed off-by-one in error message string matching.
	 Added code to avoid generating SIGPIPE on platforms
	 where this is possible (everywhere else, the main
	 application should install a handler for SIGPIPE).

Thu Oct 11 11:02:06 MDT 2007
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.1. - CG

Thu Oct 11 10:09:12 MDT 2007
	 Fixing response to include HTTP status message. - EG

Thu Sep 27 10:19:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing parsing of "%xx" in URLs with GET arguments. - eglaysher

Sun Sep  9 14:32:23 MDT 2007
	 Added option to compile debug/warning messages;
	 error messages are now disabled by default.
	 Modified linker option for GNU LD to not export
	 non-public symbols (further reduces binary size).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.0. - CG

Sat Sep  8 21:54:04 MDT 2007
	 Extended API to allow for incremental POST
	 processing.  The new API is binary-compatible
	 as long as the app does not handle POSTs, but
	 since that maybe the case, we're strictly speaking
	 breaking backwards compatibility (since url-encoded
	 POST data is no longer obtained the same way). - CG

Thu Aug 30 00:59:24 MDT 2007
	 Improving API to allow clients to associate state
         with a connection and to be notified about request
         termination (this is a binary-compatible change). - CG
	 Fixed compile errors under OS X. - HL

Sun Aug 26 03:11:46 MDT 2007
	 Added MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS option which enforces
	 receiving a "Host:" header in HTTP 1.1 (and sends a
	 HTTP 400 status back if this is violated). - CG

Tue Aug 21 01:01:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing assertion failure that occured when a client
	 closed the connection after sending some data but
	 not the full headers. - CG

Sat Aug 18 03:06:09 MDT 2007
	 Check for out of memory when adding headers to
	 responses.  Check for NULL key when looking
