@chapter Introduction


@noindent
All symbols defined in the public API start with @code{MHD_}.  MHD
is a small HTTP daemon library.  As such, it does not have any API
for logging errors (you can only enable or disable logging to stderr).
Also, it may not support all of the HTTP features directly, where
applicable, portions of HTTP may have to be handled by clients of the
library.

The library is supposed to handle everything that it must handle
(because the API would not allow clients to do this), such as basic
connection management; however, detailed interpretations of headers ---
such as range requests --- and HTTP methods are left to clients.  The
library does understand @code{HEAD} and will only send the headers of
the response and not the body, even if the client supplied a body.  The
library also understands headers that control connection management
(specifically, @code{Connection: close} and @code{Expect: 100 continue}
are understood and handled automatically).

MHD understands @code{POST} data and is able to decode certain
formats (at the moment only @code{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}
and @code{multipart/form-data}) using the post processor API.  The
data stream of a POST is also provided directly to the main
application, so unsupported encodings could still be processed, just
not conveniently by MHD.

The header file defines various constants used by the HTTP protocol.
This does not mean that MHD actually interprets all of these values.
The provided constants are exported as a convenience for users of the
library.  MHD does not verify that transmitted HTTP headers are
part of the standard specification; users of the library are free to
define their own extensions of the HTTP standard and use those with
MHD.

All functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and
thread-safe.  MHD checks for allocation failures and tries to
recover gracefully (for example, by closing the connection).
Additionally, clients can specify resource limits on the overall
number of connections, number of connections per IP address and memory
used per connection to avoid resource exhaustion.

@section Scope

MHD is currently used in a wide range of implementations.
Examples based on reports we've received from developers include:
@itemize
@item Embedded HTTP server on a cortex M3 (128 KB code space)
@item Large-scale multimedia server (reportedly serving at the
      simulator limit of 7.5 GB/s)
@item Administrative console (via HTTP/HTTPS) for network appliances
@c If you have other interesting examples, please let us know
@end itemize

@section Thread modes and event loops
@cindex poll
@cindex epoll
@cindex select

MHD supports four basic thread modes and up to three event loop
styes.

The four basic thread modes are external (MHD creates no threads,
event loop is fully managed by the application), internal (MHD creates
one thread for all connections), thread pool (MHD creates a thread
pool which is used to process all connections) and
thread-per-connection (MHD creates one listen thread and then one
thread per accepted connection).

These thread modes are then combined with the event loop styles.
MHD support select, poll and epoll.  epoll is only available on
Linux, poll may not be available on some platforms.  Note that
it is possible to combine MHD using epoll with an external
select-based event loop.

The default (if no other option is passed) is ``external select''.
The highest performance can typically be obtained with a thread pool
using @code{epoll}.  Apache Benchmark (ab) was used to compare the
performance of @code{select} and @code{epoll} when using a thread pool
and a large number of connections. @ref{fig:performance} shows the
resulting plot from the @code{benchmark.c} example, which measures the
latency between an incoming request and the completion of the
transmission of the response.  In this setting, the @code{epoll}
thread pool with four threads was able to handle more than 45,000
connections per second on loopback (with Apache Benchmark running
three processes on the same machine).
@cindex performance


@float Figure,fig:performance
@image{performance_data,400pt,300pt,Data,.png}
@caption{Performance measurements for select vs. epoll (with thread-pool).}
@end float


Not all combinations of thread modes and event loop styles are
supported.  This is partially to keep the API simple, and partially
because some combinations simply make no sense as others are strictly
superior.  Note that the choice of style depends first of all on the
application logic, and then on the performance requirements.
Applications that perform a blocking operation while handling a
request within the callbacks from MHD must use a thread per
connection.  This is typically rather costly.  Applications that do
not support threads or that must run on embedded devices without
thread-support must use the external mode.  Using @code{epoll} is only
supported on Linux, thus portable applications must at least have a
fallback option available.  @ref{tbl:supported} lists the sane
combinations.

@section Compiling GNU libmicrohttpd
@cindex compilation
@cindex embedded systems
@cindex portability

MHD uses the standard GNU system where the usual build process
involves running
@verbatim
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
@end verbatim

MHD supports various options to be given to configure to tailor the
binary to a specific situation.  Note that some of these options will
remove portions of the MHD code that are required for
binary-compatibility.  They should only be used on embedded systems
with tight resource constraints and no concerns about library
versioning.  Standard distributions including MHD are expected to
always ship with all features enabled, otherwise unexpected
incompatibilities can arise!

Here is a list of MHD-specific options that can be given to configure
(canonical configure options such as ``--prefix'' are also supported, for a
full list of options run ``./configure --help''):

@table @code
@item ``--disable-curl''
disable running testcases using libcurl

@item ``--disable-largefile''
disable support for 64-bit files

@item ``--disable-messages''
disable logging of error messages (smaller binary size, not so much fun for debugging)

@item ``--disable-https''
disable HTTPS support, even if GNUtls is found; this option must be used if eCOS license is desired as an option (in all cases the resulting binary falls under a GNU LGPL-only license)

@item ``--disable-postprocessor''
do not include the post processor API (results in binary incompatibility)

@item ``--disable-dauth''
do not include the authentication APIs (results in binary incompatibility)

@item ``--disable-epoll
do not include epoll support, even on Linux (minimally smaller binary size, good for testing portability to non-Linux systems)

@item ``--enable-coverage''
set flags for analysis of code-coverage with gcc/gcov (results in slow, large binaries)

@item ``--with-gcrypt=PATH''
specifies path to libgcrypt installation

@item ``--with-gnutls=PATH''
specifies path to libgnutls installation


@end table

@section Validity of pointers

MHD will give applications access to its internal data structures
via pointers via arguments and return values from its API.  This
creates the question as to how long those pointers are assured to
stay valid.

Most MHD data structures are associated with the connection of an
HTTP client.  Thus, pointers associated with a connection are
typically valid until the connection is finished, at which point
MHD will call the @code{MHD_RequestCompletedCallback} if one is
registered.  Applications that have such a callback registered
may assume that keys and values from the
@code{MHD_KeyValueIterator}, return values from
@code{MHD_lookup_connection_value} and the @code{url},
@code{method} and @code{version} arguments to the
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} will remain valid until the
respective @code{MHD_RequestCompletedCallback} is invoked.

In contrast, the @code{upload_data} argument of
@code{MHD_RequestCompletedCallback} as well as all pointers
from the @code{MHD_PostDataIterator} are only valid for the
duration of the callback.

Pointers returned from @code{MHD_get_response_header} are
valid as long as the response itself is valid.


@section Including the microhttpd.h header
@cindex portability
@cindex microhttpd.h

Ideally, before including "microhttpd.h" you should add the necessary
includes to define the @code{uint64_t}, @code{size_t}, @code{fd_set},
@code{socklen_t} and @code{struct sockaddr} data types.  Which
specific headers are needed may depend on your platform and your build
system might include some tests to provide you with the necessary
conditional operations.  For possible suggestions consult
@code{platform.h} and @code{configure.ac} in the MHD distribution.

Once you have ensured that you manually (!) included the right headers
for your platform before "microhttpd.h", you should also add a line
with @code{#define MHD_PLATFORM_H} which will prevent the
"microhttpd.h" header from trying (and, depending on your platform,
failing) to include the right headers.

If you do not define MHD_PLATFORM_H, the "microhttpd.h" header will
automatically include headers needed on GNU/Linux systems (possibly
causing problems when porting to other platforms).

@section SIGPIPE
@cindex signals
MHD does not install a signal handler for SIGPIPE.  On platforms
where this is possible (such as GNU/Linux), it disables SIGPIPE for
its I/O operations (by passing MSG_NOSIGNAL).  On other platforms,
SIGPIPE signals may be generated from network operations by
MHD and will cause the process to die unless the developer
explicitly installs a signal handler for SIGPIPE.

Hence portable code using MHD must install a SIGPIPE handler or
explicitly block the SIGPIPE signal.  MHD does not do so in order
to avoid messing with other parts of the application that may
need to handle SIGPIPE in a particular way.  You can make your application handle SIGPIPE by calling the following function in @code{main}:

@verbatim
static void
catcher (int sig)
{
}

static void
ignore_sigpipe ()
{
  struct sigaction oldsig;
  struct sigaction sig;

  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;
  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);
#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT
  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */
#else
  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
#endif
  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))
    fprintf (stderr,
             "Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\n", strerror (errno));
}
@end verbatim

@section MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG
@cindex long long
@cindex MHD_LONG_LONG
@cindex IAR
@cindex ARM
@cindex cortex m3
@cindex embedded systems

Some platforms do not support @code{long long}.  Hence MHD defines a
macro @code{MHD_UNSIGNED LONG_LONG} which will default to
@code{unsigned long long}.  For standard desktop operating systems,
this is all you need to know.

However, if your platform does not support @code{unsigned long long},
you should change "platform.h" to define @code{MHD_LONG_LONG} and
@code{MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG} to an appropriate alternative type and
also define @code{MHD_LONG_LONG_PRINTF} and
@code{MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_PRINTF} to the corresponding format
string for printing such a data type.  Note that the ``signed''
versions are deprecated.  Also, for historical reasons,
@code{MHD_LONG_LONG_PRINTF} is without the percent sign, whereas
@code{MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_PRINTF} is with the percent sign.  Newly
written code should only use the unsigned versions.  However, you need
to define both in "platform.h" if you need to change the definition
for the specific platform.


@section Portability to W32

libmicrohttpd in general ported well to W32. Most libmicrohttpd features
are supported. W32 do not support some functions, like epoll and
corresponding MHD features are not available on W32.


@section Portability to z/OS

To compile MHD on z/OS, extract the archive and run

@verbatim
iconv -f UTF-8 -t IBM-1047 contrib/ascebc > /tmp/ascebc.sh
chmod +x /tmp/ascebc.sh
for n in `find * -type f`
do
  /tmp/ascebc.sh $n
done
@end verbatim
to convert all source files to EBCDIC.  Note that you must run
@code{configure} from the directory where the configure script is
located.   Otherwise, configure will fail to find the
@code{contrib/xcc} script (which is a wrapper around the z/OS c89
compiler).

@chapter Constants


@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_FLAG
Options for the MHD daemon.

Note that if neither @code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION} nor
@code{MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY} is used, the client wants control over
the process and will call the appropriate microhttpd callbacks.

Starting the daemon may also fail if a particular option is not
implemented or not supported on the target platform (i.e. no support for
@acronym{SSL}, threads or IPv6).  SSL support generally depends on
options given during MHD compilation.  Threaded operations
(including @code{MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY}) are not supported on
Symbian.

@table @code
@item MHD_NO_FLAG
No options selected.

@item MHD_USE_DEBUG
@cindex debugging
Run in debug mode.  If this flag is used, the library should print error
messages and warnings to stderr.  Note that for this
run-time option to have any effect, MHD needs to be
compiled with messages enabled. This is done by default except you ran
configure with the @code{--disable-messages} flag set.

@item MHD_USE_SSL
@cindex TLS
@cindex SSL
Run in HTTPS-mode.  If you specify @code{MHD_USE_SSL} and MHD was
compiled without SSL support, @code{MHD_start_daemon} will return
NULL.

@item MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION
Run using one thread per connection.

@item MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY
Run using an internal thread doing @code{SELECT}.

@item MHD_USE_IPv6
@cindex IPv6
Run using the IPv6 protocol (otherwise, MHD will just support IPv4).
If you specify @code{MHD_USE_IPV6} and the local platform does not
support it, @code{MHD_start_daemon} will return NULL.

If you want MHD to support IPv4 and IPv6 using a single socket, pass
MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK, otherwise, if you only pass this option, MHD will
try to bind to IPv6-only (resulting in no IPv4 support).

@item MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK
@cindex IPv6
Use a single socket for IPv4 and IPv6.  Note that this will mean
that IPv4 addresses are returned by MHD in the IPv6-mapped format
(the 'struct sockaddr_in6' format will be used for IPv4 and IPv6).

@item MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS
Be pedantic about the protocol (as opposed to as tolerant as possible).
Specifically, at the moment, this flag causes MHD to reject HTTP
1.1 connections without a @code{Host} header.  This is required by the
standard, but of course in violation of the ``be as liberal as possible
in what you accept'' norm.  It is recommended to turn this @strong{ON}
if you are testing clients against MHD, and @strong{OFF} in
production.

@item MHD_USE_POLL
@cindex FD_SETSIZE
@cindex poll
@cindex select
Use @code{poll()} instead of @code{select()}. This allows sockets with
descriptors @code{>= FD_SETSIZE}.  This option currently only works in
conjunction with @code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION} or
@code{MHD_USE_INTERNAL_SELECT} (at this point).  If you specify
@code{MHD_USE_POLL} and the local platform does not support it,
@code{MHD_start_daemon} will return NULL.

@item MHD_USE_EPOLL_LINUX_ONLY
@cindex FD_SETSIZE
@cindex epoll
@cindex select
Use @code{epoll()} instead of @code{poll()} or @code{select()}. This
allows sockets with descriptors @code{>= FD_SETSIZE}.  This option is
only available on Linux systems and does not work in conjunction with
@code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION} (at this point).  If you specify
@code{MHD_USE_EPOLL_LINUX_ONLY} and the local platform does not
support it, @code{MHD_start_daemon} will return NULL.  Using
@code{epoll()} instead of @code{select()} or @code{poll()} can in some
situations result in significantly higher performance as the system
call has fundamentally lower complexity (O(1) for @code{epoll()}
vs. O(n) for @code{select()}/@code{poll()} where n is the number of
open connections).

@item MHD_SUPPRESS_DATE_NO_CLOCK
@cindex date
@cindex clock
@cindex embedded systems
Suppress (automatically) adding the 'Date:' header to HTTP responses.
This option should ONLY be used on systems that do not have a clock
and that DO provide other mechanisms for cache control.  See also
RFC 2616, section 14.18 (exception 3).


@item MHD_USE_NO_LISTEN_SOCKET
@cindex listen
@cindex proxy
@cindex embedded systems
Run the HTTP server without any listen socket.  This option only makes
sense if @code{MHD_add_connection} is going to be used exclusively to
connect HTTP clients to the HTTP server.  This option is incompatible
with using a thread pool; if it is used,
@code{MHD_OPTION_THREAD_POOL_SIZE} is ignored.

@item MHD_USE_PIPE_FOR_SHUTDOWN
@cindex quiesce
Force MHD to use a signal pipe to notify the event loop (of threads)
of our shutdown.  This is required if an appliction uses
@code{MHD_USE_INTERNAL_SELECT} or @code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION}
and then performs @code{MHD_quiesce_daemon} (which eliminates our
ability to signal termination via the listen socket).  In these modes,
@code{MHD_quiesce_daemon} will fail if this option was not set.  Also,
use of this option is automatic (as in, you do not even have to
specify it), if @code{MHD_USE_NO_LISTEN_SOCKET} is specified.  In
"external" select mode, this option is always simply ignored.

Using this option also guarantees that MHD will not call
@code{shutdown()} on the listen socket, which means a parent
process can continue to use the socket.

@item MHD_USE_SUSPEND_RESUME
Enables using @code{MHD_suspend_connection} and
@code{MHD_resume_connection}, as performing these calls requires some
additional pipes to be created, and code not using these calls should
not pay the cost.

@item MHD_USE_TCP_FASTOPEN
@cindex listen
Enable TCP_FASTOPEN on the listen socket.  TCP_FASTOPEN is currently
supported on Linux >= 3.6.  On other systems using this option with
cause @code{MHD_start_daemon} to fail.

@end table
@end deftp


@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_OPTION
MHD options.  Passed in the varargs portion of
@code{MHD_start_daemon()}.

@table @code
@item MHD_OPTION_END
No more options / last option.  This is used to terminate the VARARGs
list.

@item MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT
@cindex memory, limiting memory utilization
Maximum memory size per connection (followed by a @code{size_t}).  The
default is 32 kB (32*1024 bytes) as defined by the internal constant
@code{MHD_POOL_SIZE_DEFAULT}.  Values above 128k are unlikely to
result in much benefit, as half of the memory will be typically used
for IO, and TCP buffers are unlikely to support window sizes above 64k
on most systems.

@item MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_INCREMENT
@cindex memory
Increment to use for growing the read buffer (followed by a
@code{size_t}).  The default is 1024 (bytes).  Increasing this value
will make MHD use memory for reading more aggressively, which can
reduce the number of @code{recvfrom} calls but may increase the number
of @code{sendto} calls.  The given value must fit within
MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT.

@item MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT
@cindex connection, limiting number of connections
Maximum number of concurrent connections to accept (followed by an
@code{unsigned int}).  The default is @code{FD_SETSIZE - 4} (the
maximum number of file descriptors supported by @code{select} minus
four for @code{stdin}, @code{stdout}, @code{stderr} and the server
socket).  In other words, the default is as large as possible.

Note that if you set a low connection limit, you can easily get into
trouble with browsers doing request pipelining.  For example, if your
connection limit is ``1'', a browser may open a first connection to
access your ``index.html'' file, keep it open but use a second
connection to retrieve CSS files, images and the like.  In fact, modern
browsers are typically by default configured for up to 15 parallel
connections to a single server.  If this happens, MHD will refuse to
even accept the second connection until the first connection is
closed --- which does not happen until timeout.  As a result, the
browser will fail to render the page and seem to hang.  If you expect
your server to operate close to the connection limit, you should
first consider using a lower timeout value and also possibly add
a ``Connection: close'' header to your response to ensure that
request pipelining is not used and connections are closed immediately
after the request has completed:
@example
MHD_add_response_header (response,
                         MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION,
                         "close");
@end example

@item MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
@cindex timeout
After how many seconds of inactivity should a connection automatically
be timed out? (followed by an @code{unsigned int}; use zero for no
timeout).  The default is zero (no timeout).

@item MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED
Register a function that should be called whenever a request has been
completed (this can be used for application-specific clean up).
Requests that have never been presented to the application (via
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()}) will not result in
notifications.

This option should be followed by @strong{TWO} pointers.  First a
pointer to a function of type @code{MHD_RequestCompletedCallback()}
and second a pointer to a closure to pass to the request completed
callback.  The second pointer maybe @code{NULL}.

@item MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_CONNECTION
Register a function that should be called when the TCP connection to a
client is opened or closed.  Note that
@code{MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED} and the @code{con_cls} argument to
the @code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} are per HTTP request (and there
can be multiple HTTP requests per TCP connection).  The registered
callback is called twice per TCP connection, with
@code{MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_STARTED} and
@code{MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_CLOSED} respectively.  An additional
argument can be used to store TCP connection specific information,
which can be retrieved using @code{MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT}
during the lifetime of the TCP connection.  The respective location is
not the same as the HTTP-request-specific @code{con_cls} from the
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback}.

This option should be followed by @strong{TWO} pointers.  First a
pointer to a function of type @code{MHD_NotifyConnectionCallback()}
and second a pointer to a closure to pass to the request completed
callback.  The second pointer maybe @code{NULL}.

@item MHD_OPTION_PER_IP_CONNECTION_LIMIT
Limit on the number of (concurrent) connections made to the
server from the same IP address.  Can be used to prevent one
IP from taking over all of the allowed connections.  If the
same IP tries to establish more than the specified number of
connections, they will be immediately rejected.  The option
should be followed by an @code{unsigned int}.  The default is
zero, which means no limit on the number of connections
from the same IP address.

@item MHD_OPTION_SOCK_ADDR
@cindex bind, restricting bind
Bind daemon to the supplied socket address. This option should be followed by a
@code{struct sockaddr *}.  If @code{MHD_USE_IPv6} is specified,
the @code{struct sockaddr*} should point to a @code{struct sockaddr_in6},
otherwise to a @code{struct sockaddr_in}.  If this option is not specified,
the daemon will listen to incoming connections from anywhere.  If you use this
option, the 'port' argument from @code{MHD_start_daemon} is ignored and the port
from the given @code{struct sockaddr *} will be used instead.

@item MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK
@cindex debugging
@cindex logging
@cindex query string
Specify a function that should be called before parsing the URI from
the client.  The specified callback function can be used for processing
the URI (including the options) before it is parsed.  The URI after
parsing will no longer contain the options, which maybe inconvenient for
logging.  This option should be followed by two arguments, the first
one must be of the form
@example
 void * my_logger(void * cls, const char * uri, struct MHD_Connection *con)
@end example
where the return value will be passed as
@code{*con_cls} in calls to the @code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback}
when this request is processed later; returning a
value of @code{NULL} has no special significance; (however,
note that if you return non-@code{NULL}, you can no longer
rely on the first call to the access handler having
@code{NULL == *con_cls} on entry)
@code{cls} will be set to the second argument following
MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK.  Finally, @code{uri} will
be the 0-terminated URI of the request.

Note that during the time of this call, most of the connection's state
is not initialized (as we have not yet parsed he headers).  However,
information about the connecting client (IP, socket) is available.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
Memory pointer to the private key to be used by the
HTTPS daemon.  This option should be followed by an
"const char*" argument.
This should be used in conjunction with 'MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT'.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_KEY_PASSWORD
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
Memory pointer to the password that decrypts the
private key to be used by the HTTPS daemon.
This option should be followed by an
"const char*" argument.
This should be used in conjunction with 'MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY'.

The password (or passphrase) is only used immediately during
@code{MHD_start_daemon()}.  Thus, the application may want to
erase it from memory afterwards for additional security.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
Memory pointer to the certificate to be used by the
HTTPS daemon.  This option should be followed by an
"const char*" argument.
This should be used in conjunction with 'MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY'.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_TRUST
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
Memory pointer to the CA certificate to be used by the
HTTPS daemon to authenticate and trust clients certificates.
This option should be followed by an "const char*" argument.
The presence of this option activates the request of certificate
to the client. The request to the client is marked optional, and
it is the responsibility of the server to check the presence
of the certificate if needed.
Note that most browsers will only present a client certificate
only if they have one matching the specified CA, not sending
any certificate otherwise.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CRED_TYPE
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
Daemon credentials type.  Either certificate or anonymous,
this option should be followed by one of the values listed in
"enum gnutls_credentials_type_t".

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_PRIORITIES
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
@cindex cipher
SSL/TLS protocol version and ciphers.
This option must be followed by an "const char *" argument
specifying the SSL/TLS protocol versions and ciphers that
are acceptable for the application.  The string is passed
unchanged to gnutls_priority_init.  If this option is not
specified, ``NORMAL'' is used.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_CERT_CALLBACK
@cindex SSL
@cindex TLS
@cindex SNI
Use a callback to determine which X.509 certificate should be used for
a given HTTPS connection.  This option should be followed by a
argument of type "gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 *".  This
option provides an alternative to MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY and
MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT.  You must use this version if multiple
domains are to be hosted at the same IP address using TLS's Server
Name Indication (SNI) extension.  In this case, the callback is
expected to select the correct certificate based on the SNI
information provided.  The callback is expected to access the SNI data
using gnutls_server_name_get().  Using this option requires GnuTLS 3.0
or higher.

@item MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM
@cindex digest auth
@cindex random
Digest Authentication nonce's seed.

This option should be followed by two arguments.  First an integer of
type "size_t" which specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by the
second argument in bytes.  Note that the application must ensure that
the buffer of the second argument remains allocated and unmodified
while the daemon is running.  For security, you SHOULD provide a fresh
random nonce when using MHD with Digest Authentication.

@item MHD_OPTION_NONCE_NC_SIZE
@cindex digest auth
@cindex replay attack

Size of an array of nonce and nonce counter map.  This option must be
followed by an "unsigned int" argument that have the size (number of
elements) of a map of a nonce and a nonce-counter.  If this option
is not specified, a default value of 4 will be used (which might be
too small for servers handling many requests).  If you do not use
digest authentication at all, you can specify a value of zero to
save some memory.

You should calculate the value of NC_SIZE based on the number of
connections per second multiplied by your expected session duration
plus a factor of about two for hash table collisions.  For example, if
you expect 100 digest-authenticated connections per second and the
average user to stay on your site for 5 minutes, then you likely need
a value of about 60000.  On the other hand, if you can only expect
only 10 digest-authenticated connections per second, tolerate browsers
getting a fresh nonce for each request and expect a HTTP request
latency of 250 ms, then a value of about 5 should be fine.


@item MHD_OPTION_LISTEN_SOCKET
@cindex systemd
Listen socket to use.  Pass a listen socket for MHD to use
(systemd-style).  If this option is used, MHD will not open its own
listen socket(s). The argument passed must be of type "int" and refer
to an existing socket that has been bound to a port and is listening.

@item MHD_OPTION_EXTERNAL_LOGGER
@cindex logging
Use the given function for logging error messages.
This option must be followed by two arguments; the
first must be a pointer to a function
of type 'void fun(void * arg, const char * fmt, va_list ap)'
and the second a pointer of type 'void*' which will
be passed as the "arg" argument to "fun".

Note that MHD will not generate any log messages without
the MHD_USE_DEBUG flag set and if MHD was compiled
with the "--disable-messages" flag.

@item MHD_OPTION_THREAD_POOL_SIZE
@cindex performance
Number (unsigned int) of threads in thread pool. Enable
thread pooling by setting this value to to something
greater than 1. Currently, thread model must be
MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY if thread pooling is enabled
(@code{MHD_start_daemon} returns @code{NULL} for an unsupported thread
model).

@item MHD_OPTION_ARRAY
@cindex options
@cindex foreign-function interface
This option can be used for initializing MHD using options from an
array.  A common use for this is writing an FFI for MHD.  The actual
options given are in an array of 'struct MHD_OptionItem', so this
option requires a single argument of type 'struct MHD_OptionItem'.
The array must be terminated with an entry @code{MHD_OPTION_END}.

An example for code using MHD_OPTION_ARRAY is:
@example
struct MHD_OptionItem ops[] = @{
 @{ MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT, 100, NULL @},
 @{ MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, 10, NULL @},
 @{ MHD_OPTION_END, 0, NULL @}
@};
d = MHD_start_daemon(0, 8080, NULL, NULL, dh, NULL,
                     MHD_OPTION_ARRAY, ops,
                     MHD_OPTION_END);
@end example
For options that expect a single pointer argument, the
second member of the @code{struct MHD_OptionItem} is ignored.
For options that expect two pointer arguments, the first
argument must be cast to @code{intptr_t}.

@item MHD_OPTION_UNESCAPE_CALLBACK
@cindex internationalization
@cindex escaping

Specify a function that should be called for unescaping escape
sequences in URIs and URI arguments.  Note that this function will NOT
be used by the MHD_PostProcessor.  If this option is not specified,
the default method will be used which decodes escape sequences of the
form "%HH".  This option should be followed by two arguments, the
first one must be of the form

@example
  size_t my_unescaper(void * cls, struct MHD_Connection *c, char *s)
@end example

where the return value must be @code{strlen(s)} and @code{s} should be
updated.  Note that the unescape function must not lengthen @code{s}
(the result must be shorter than the input and still be 0-terminated).
@code{cls} will be set to the second argument following
MHD_OPTION_UNESCAPE_CALLBACK.


@item MHD_OPTION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
@cindex stack
@cindex thread
@cindex pthread
@cindex embedded systems
Maximum stack size for threads created by MHD.  This option must be
followed by a @code{size_t}).  Not specifying this option or using
a value of zero means using the system default (which is likely to
differ based on your platform).

@item MHD_OPTION_TCP_FASTQUEUE_QUEUE_SIZE
@cindex listen
When the flag @code{MHD_USE_TCP_FASTOPEN} is used, this option sets the
connection handshake queue size for the TCP FASTOPEN connections.  Note
that a TCP FASTOPEN connection handshake occupies more resources than a
TCP handshake as the SYN packets also contain DATA which is kept in the
associate state until handshake is completed.  If this option is not
given the queue size is set to a default value of 10.  This option must
be followed by a @code{unsigned int}.

@item MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_DHPARAMS
@cindex TLS
@cindex SSL
@cindex DH
Memory pointer for the Diffie-Hellman parameters (dh.pem) to be used
by the HTTPS daemon for key exchange.  This option must be followed by
a @code{const char *} argument.  The argument would be a zero-terminated
string with a PEM encoded PKCS3 DH parameters structure suitable
for passing to @code{gnutls_dh_parms_import_pkcs3}.

@item MHD_OPTION_LISTENING_ADDRESS_REUSE
@cindex bind, restricting bind
@cindex reusing listening address
This option must be followed by a @code{unsigned int} argument.
If this option is present and true (nonzero) parameter is given, allow reusing
the address:port of the listening socket (using @code{SO_REUSEPORT} on most
platforms, and @code{SO_REUSEADDR} on Windows).  If a false (zero) parameter is
given, disallow reusing the the address:port of the listening socket (this
usually requires no special action, but @code{SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE} is needed on
Windows).  If this option is not present, default behaviour is undefined
(currently, @code{SO_REUSEADDR} is used on all platforms, which disallows
address:port reusing with the exception of Windows).

@end table
@end deftp


@deftp {C Struct} MHD_OptionItem
Entry in an MHD_OPTION_ARRAY.  See the @code{MHD_OPTION_ARRAY} option
argument for its use.

The @code{option} member is used to specify which option is specified
in the array.  The other members specify the respective argument.

Note that for options taking only a single pointer, the
@code{ptr_value} member should be set.  For options taking two pointer
arguments, the first pointer must be cast to @code{intptr_t} and both
the @code{value} and the @code{ptr_value} members should be used to
pass the two pointers.
@end deftp


@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_ValueKind
The @code{MHD_ValueKind} specifies the source of the key-value pairs in
the HTTP protocol.

@table @code
@item MHD_RESPONSE_HEADER_KIND
Response header.

@item MHD_HEADER_KIND
HTTP header.

@item MHD_COOKIE_KIND
@cindex cookie
Cookies.  Note that the original HTTP header containing the cookie(s)
will still be available and intact.

@item MHD_POSTDATA_KIND
@cindex POST method
@code{POST} data.  This is available only if a content encoding
supported by MHD is used (currently only @acronym{URL} encoding), and
only if the posted content fits within the available memory pool.  Note
that in that case, the upload data given to the
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()} will be empty (since it has
already been processed).

@item MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND
@code{GET} (URI) arguments.

@item MHD_FOOTER_KIND
HTTP footer (only for http 1.1 chunked encodings).

@end table

has been terminated (or completed).

@table @code
@item MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK

@item MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR
Error handling the connection (resources exhausted, other side closed
connection, application error accepting request, etc.)

@item MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED
No activity on the connection for the number of seconds specified using

@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_ResponseMemoryMode
The @code{MHD_ResponeMemoryMode} specifies how MHD should treat
the memory buffer given for the response in
@code{MHD_create_response_from_buffer}.

@table @code
@item MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT
Buffer is a persistent (static/global) buffer that won't change
for at least the lifetime of the response, MHD should just use
it, not free it, not copy it, just keep an alias to it.

@item MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE
Buffer is heap-allocated with @code{malloc} (or equivalent) and
should be freed by MHD after processing the response has
concluded (response reference counter reaches zero).

@item MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY
Buffer is in transient memory, but not on the heap (for example,
on the stack or non-malloc allocated) and only valid during the
call to @code{MHD_create_response_from_buffer}.  MHD must make its
own private copy of the data for processing.

@chapter Callback functions definition


@deftypefn {Function Pointer} int {*MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback} (void *cls, const struct sockaddr * addr, socklen_t addrlen)
Invoked in the context of a connection to allow or deny a client to
connect.  This callback return @code{MHD_YES} if connection is allowed,
@code{MHD_NO} if not.

@table @var
@item cls
custom value selected at callback registration time;
@item addr
address information from the client;
@item addrlen
length of the address information.
@end table
@end deftypefn


@deftypefn {Function Pointer} int {*MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection * connection, const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
Invoked in the context of a connection to answer a request from the
client.  This callback must call MHD functions (example: the
@code{MHD_Response} ones) to provide content to give back to the client
and return an HTTP status code (i.e. @code{200} for OK, @code{404},
etc.).

@ref{microhttpd-post}, for details on how to code this callback.

Must return @code{MHD_YES} if the connection was handled successfully,
@code{MHD_NO} if the socket must be closed due to a serious error while
handling the request

@table @var
@item cls
custom value selected at callback registration time;

@item url
the URL requested by the client;

@item method
the HTTP method used by the client (@code{GET}, @code{PUT},
@code{DELETE}, @code{POST}, etc.);

@item version
the HTTP version string (i.e. @code{HTTP/1.1});

@item upload_data
the data being uploaded (excluding headers):
@cindex POST method
@cindex PUT method

@code{POST} data @strong{will} be made available
incrementally in @var{upload_data}; even if @code{POST}
data is available, the first time the callback is
invoked there won't be upload data, as this is done
just after MHD parses the headers.  If supported by
the client and the HTTP version, the application can
at this point queue an error response to possibly
avoid the upload entirely. If no response is generated,
MHD will (if required) automatically send a 100 CONTINUE
reply to the client.

Afterwards, POST data will be passed to the callback
to be processed incrementally by the application. The
application may return @code{MHD_NO} to forcefully
terminate the TCP connection without generating a
proper HTTP response. Once all of the upload data has
been provided to the application, the application
will be called again with 0 bytes of upload data.
At this point, a response should be queued to complete
the handling of the request.

@item upload_data_size
set initially to the size of the @var{upload_data} provided; this
callback must update this value to the number of bytes @strong{NOT}
processed; unless external select is used, the callback maybe
required to process at least some data.  If the callback fails to
process data in multi-threaded or internal-select mode and if the
read-buffer is already at the maximum size that MHD is willing to
use for reading (about half of the maximum amount of memory allowed
for the connection), then MHD will abort handling the connection
and return an internal server error to the client.  In order to
avoid this, clients must be able to process upload data incrementally
and reduce the value of @code{upload_data_size}.

@item con_cls
reference to a pointer, initially set to @code{NULL}, that this callback can
set to some address and that will be preserved by MHD for future
calls for this request;

since the access handler may be called many times (i.e., for a
@code{PUT}/@code{POST} operation with plenty of upload data) this allows
the application to easily associate some request-specific state;

if necessary, this state can be cleaned up in the global
@code{MHD_RequestCompletedCallback} (which can be set with the
@code{MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED}).
@end table
@end deftypefn


@deftypefn {Function Pointer} void {*MHD_RequestCompletedCallback} (void *cls, struct MHD_Connectionconnection, void **con_cls, enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)
Signature of the callback used by MHD to notify the application about
completed requests.

@table @var
@item cls
custom value selected at callback registration time;

@item connection
connection handle;

@item con_cls
value as set by the last call to the

@deftypefn {Function Pointer} int {*MHD_KeyValueIterator} (void *cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *value)
Iterator over key-value pairs.  This iterator can be used to iterate
over all of the cookies, headers, or @code{POST}-data fields of a
request, and also to iterate over the headers that have been added to a
response.

@table @var
@item cls
custom value specified when iteration was triggered;

@item kind
kind of the header we are looking at

@item key
key for the value, can be an empty string

@item value
value corresponding value, can be NULL

@end table

Return @code{MHD_YES} to continue iterating, @code{MHD_NO} to abort the
iteration.
@end deftypefn


@deftypefn {Function Pointer} int {*MHD_ContentReaderCallback} (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *buf, size_t max)
Callback used by MHD in order to obtain content.  The callback has to
copy at most @var{max} bytes of content into @var{buf}.  The total
number of bytes that has been placed into @var{buf} should be returned.

Note that returning zero will cause MHD to try again.
Thus, returning zero should only be used in conjunction
with @code{MHD_suspend_connection()} to avoid busy waiting.

While usually the callback simply returns the number of bytes written
into @var{buf}, there are two special return value:

@code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM} (-1) should be returned
for the regular end of transmission (with chunked encoding, MHD will then
terminate the chunk and send any HTTP footers that might be
present; without chunked encoding and given an unknown
response size, MHD will simply close the connection; note
that while returning @code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM} is not technically
legal if a response size was specified, MHD accepts this
and treats it just as @code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR}.

@code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR} (-2) is used to indicate a server
error generating the response; this will cause MHD to simply
close the connection immediately.  If a response size was
given or if chunked encoding is in use, this will indicate
an error to the client.  Note, however, that if the client
does not know a response size and chunked encoding is not in
use, then clients will not be able to tell the difference between
@code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR} and
@code{MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM}.
This is not a limitation of MHD but rather of the HTTP protocol.

@table @var
@item cls
custom value selected at callback registration time;

@item pos
position in the datastream to access; note that if an
@code{MHD_Response} object is re-used, it is possible for the same
content reader to be queried multiple times for the same data; however,
if an @code{MHD_Response} is not re-used, MHD guarantees that
@var{pos} will be the sum of all non-negative return values obtained
from the content reader so far.
@end table

Return @code{-1} on error (MHD will no longer try to read content and
instead close the connection with the client).
@end deftypefn


@deftypefn {Function Pointer} void {*MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback} (void *cls)
This method is called by MHD if we are done with a content reader.
It should be used to free resources associated with the content reader.

@deftypefn {Function Pointer} int {*MHD_PostDataIterator} (void *cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *filename, const char *content_type, const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off, size_t size)
Iterator over key-value pairs where the value maybe made available in
increments and/or may not be zero-terminated.  Used for processing
@code{POST} data.

@table @var
@item cls
custom value selected at callback registration time;

@item kind

Return @code{NULL} on error, handle to daemon on success.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_quiesce_daemon (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
@cindex quiesce
Stop accepting connections from the listening socket.  Allows clients
to continue processing, but stops accepting new connections.  Note
that the caller is responsible for closing the returned socket;
however, if MHD is run using threads (anything but external select
mode), it must not be closed until AFTER @code{MHD_stop_daemon} has
been called (as it is theoretically possible that an existing thread
is still using it).

This function is useful in the special case that a listen socket
is to be migrated to another process (i.e. a newer version of the
HTTP server) while existing connections should continue to be
processed until they are finished.

Return @code{-1} on error (daemon not listening), the handle to the
listen socket otherwise.

@end deftypefun


@deftypefun void MHD_stop_daemon (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
Shutdown an HTTP daemon.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
Run webserver operations (without blocking unless in client callbacks).
This method should be called by clients in combination with
@code{MHD_get_fdset()} if the client-controlled @code{select}-method is used.
@cindex select
@cindex poll

This function will work for external @code{poll} and @code{select} mode.
However, if using external @code{select} mode, you may want to
instead use @code{MHD_run_from_select}, as it is more efficient.

@table @var

@deftypefun int MHD_run_from_select (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, const fd_set *read_fd_set, const fd_set *write_fd_set, const fd_set *except_fd_set)
Run webserver operations given sets of ready socket handles.
@cindex select

This method should be called by clients in combination with
@code{MHD_get_fdset} if the client-controlled (external)
select method is used.

You can use this function instead of @code{MHD_run} if you called
@code{select} on the result from @code{MHD_get_fdset}.  File descriptors in
the sets that are not controlled by MHD will be ignored.  Calling
this function instead of @code{MHD_run} is more efficient as MHD will
not have to call @code{select} again to determine which operations are
ready.

@table @var
@item daemon
daemon to process connections of
@item read_fd_set
set of descriptors that must be ready for reading without blocking
@item write_fd_set

@deftypefun void MHD_add_connection (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, int client_socket, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)
Add another client connection to the set of connections
managed by MHD.  This API is usually not needed (since
MHD will accept inbound connections on the server socket).
Use this API in special cases, for example if your HTTP
server is behind NAT and needs to connect out to the
HTTP client, or if you are building a proxy.

If you use this API in conjunction with a internal select or a thread
pool, you must set the option @code{MHD_USE_PIPE_FOR_SHUTDOWN} to
ensure that the freshly added connection is immediately processed by
MHD.

The given client socket will be managed (and closed!) by MHD after
this call and must no longer be used directly by the application
afterwards.

@table @var
@item daemon
daemon that manages the connection
@item client_socket
socket to manage (MHD will expect to receive an HTTP request from this socket next).
@item addr
IP address of the client
@item addrlen
number of bytes in addr
@end table

This function will return @code{MHD_YES} on success,
@code{MHD_NO} if this daemon could
not handle the connection (i.e. malloc failed, etc).
The socket will be closed in any case; 'errno' is set
to indicate further details about the error.

Obtain the @code{select()} sets for this daemon. The daemon's socket
is added to @var{read_fd_set}. The list of currently existent
connections is scanned and their file descriptors added to the correct

After the call completed successfully: the variable referenced by

@cindex timeout
Obtain timeout value for select for this daemon (only needed if

@chapter Handling requests


@deftypefun int MHD_get_connection_values (struct MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
Get all the headers matching @var{kind} from the request.  The @var{kind}
argument can be a bitmask, ORing the various header kinds that are
requested.

The @var{iterator} callback is invoked once for each header, with
@var{iterator_cls} as first argument.  After version 0.9.19, the
headers are iterated in the same order as they were received from
the network; previous versions iterated over the headers in reverse
order.

@code{MHD_get_connection_values} returns the number of entries
iterated over; this can be less than the number of headers if, while
iterating, @var{iterator} returns @code{MHD_NO}.

@var{iterator} can be @code{NULL}: in this case this function just counts
and returns the number of headers.

In the case of @code{MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND}, the @var{value} argument
will be @code{NULL} if the URL contained a key without an equals operator.
For example, for a HTTP request to the URL ``http://foo/bar?key'', the
@var{value} argument is @code{NULL}; in contrast, a HTTP request to the URL
``http://foo/bar?key='', the @var{value} argument is the empty string.
The normal case is that the URL contains ``http://foo/bar?key=value''
in which case @var{value} would be the string ``value'' and @var{key}
would contain the string ``key''.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_set_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *value)
This function can be used to append an entry to
the list of HTTP headers of a connection (so that the
@code{MHD_get_connection_values function} will return
them -- and the MHD PostProcessor will also
see them).  This maybe required in certain
situations (see Mantis #1399) where (broken)
HTTP implementations fail to supply values needed
by the post processor (or other parts of the
application).

This function MUST only be called from within
the MHD_AccessHandlerCallback (otherwise, access
maybe improperly synchronized).  Furthermore,
the client must guarantee that the key and
value arguments are 0-terminated strings that
are NOT freed until the connection is closed.
(The easiest way to do this is by passing only
arguments to permanently allocated strings.).

@var{connection} is the connection for which
the entry for @var{key} of the given @var{kind}
should be set to the given @var{value}.

The function returns @code{MHD_NO} if the operation
could not be performed due to insufficient memory
and @code{MHD_YES} on success.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {const char *} MHD_lookup_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key)
Get a particular header value.  If multiple values match the
@var{kind}, return one of them (the ``first'', whatever that means).
@var{key} must reference a zero-terminated ASCII-coded string
representing the header to look for: it is compared against the
headers using @code{strcasecmp()}, so case is ignored.  A value of
@code{NULL} for @var{key} can be used to lookup 'trailing' values without a
key, for example if a URI is of the form
``http://example.com/?trailer'', a @var{key} of @code{NULL} can be used to
access ``tailer" The function returns @code{NULL} if no matching item
was found.

@chapter Building responses to requests


@noindent
Response objects handling by MHD is asynchronous with respect to the
application execution flow. Instances of the @code{MHD_Response}
structure are not associated to a daemon and neither to a client
connection: they are managed with reference counting.

In the simplest case: we allocate a new @code{MHD_Response} structure
for each response, we use it once and finally we destroy it.

MHD allows more efficient resources usages.

Example: we allocate a new @code{MHD_Response} structure for each
response @strong{kind}, we use it every time we have to give that
response and we finally destroy it only when the daemon shuts down.

@node microhttpd-response enqueue
@section Enqueuing a response


@deftypefun int MHD_queue_response (struct MHD_Connection *connection, unsigned int status_code, struct MHD_Response *response)
Queue a response to be transmitted to the client as soon as possible
but only after MHD_AccessHandlerCallback returns.  This function
checks that it is legal to queue a response at this time for the
given connection.  It also increments the internal reference
counter for the response object (the counter will be decremented
automatically once the response has been transmitted).

@table @var
@item connection
the connection identifying the client;

@item status_code
HTTP status code (i.e. @code{200} for OK);

@item response
response to transmit.
@end table

Return @code{MHD_YES} on success or if message has been queued.  Return
@code{MHD_NO}: if arguments are invalid (example: @code{NULL} pointer); on
error (i.e. reply already sent).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun void MHD_destroy_response (struct MHD_Response *response)
Destroy a response object and associated resources (decrement the
reference counter).  Note that MHD may keep some of the resources
around if the response is still in the queue for some clients, so the
memory may not necessarily be freed immediately.
@end deftypefun


An explanation of reference counting@footnote{Note to readers acquainted
to the Tcl API: reference counting on @code{MHD_Connection}
structures is handled in the same way as Tcl handles @code{Tcl_Obj}
structures through @code{Tcl_IncrRefCount()} and
@code{Tcl_DecrRefCount()}.}:

@enumerate
@item
a @code{MHD_Response} object is allocated:

@example
struct MHD_Response * response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer(...);
/* here: reference counter = 1 */
@end example

@item
the @code{MHD_Response} object is enqueued in a @code{MHD_Connection}:

@example
MHD_queue_response(connection, , response);
/* here: reference counter = 2 */
@end example

@item
the creator of the response object discharges responsibility for it:

@example
MHD_destroy_response(response);
/* here: reference counter = 1 */
@end example

@item
the daemon handles the connection sending the response's data to the
client then decrements the reference counter by calling
@code{MHD_destroy_response()}: the counter's value drops to zero and
the @code{MHD_Response} object is released.

@section Creating a response object


@deftypefun {struct MHD_Response *} MHD_create_response_from_callback (uint64_t size, size_t block_size, MHD_ContentReaderCallback crc, void *crc_cls, MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)
Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
header information and then it can be used any number of times.

@table @var
@item size
size of the data portion of the response, @code{-1} for unknown;

@item block_size
preferred block size for querying @var{crc} (advisory only, MHD may
still call @var{crc} using smaller chunks); this is essentially the
buffer size used for @acronym{IO}, clients should pick a value that is
appropriate for @acronym{IO} and memory performance requirements;

@item crc
callback to use to obtain response data;

@item crc_cls
extra argument to @var{crc};

@item crfc
callback to call to free @var{crc_cls} resources.
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).
@end deftypefun



@deftypefun {struct MHD_Response *} MHD_create_response_from_fd (uint64_t size, int fd)
Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
header information and then it can be used any number of times.

@table @var
@item size
size of the data portion of the response (should be smaller or equal to the
size of the file)

@item fd
file descriptor referring to a file on disk with the data; will be
closed when response is destroyed; note that 'fd' must be an actual
file descriptor (not a pipe or socket) since MHD might use 'sendfile'
or 'seek' on it.  The descriptor should be in blocking-IO mode.
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {struct MHD_Response *} MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (size_t size, int fd, off_t offset)
Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
header information and then it can be used any number of times.
Note that you need to be a bit careful about @code{off_t} when
writing this code.  Depending on your platform, MHD is likely
to have been compiled with support for 64-bit files.  When you
compile your own application, you must make sure that @code{off_t}
is also a 64-bit value.  If not, your compiler may pass a 32-bit
value as @code{off_t}, which will result in 32-bits of garbage.

If you use the autotools, use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} autoconf
macro and make sure to include the generated @file{config.h} file
before @file{microhttpd.h} to avoid problems.  If you do not have a
build system and only want to run on a GNU/Linux system, you could
also use
@verbatim
#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <microhttpd.h>
@end verbatim
to ensure 64-bit @code{off_t}.  Note that if your operating system
does not support 64-bit files, MHD will be compiled with a 32-bit
@code{off_t} (in which case the above would be wrong).

@table @var
@item size
size of the data portion of the response (number of bytes to transmit from the
file starting at offset).

@item fd
file descriptor referring to a file on disk with the data; will be
closed when response is destroyed; note that 'fd' must be an actual
file descriptor (not a pipe or socket) since MHD might use 'sendfile'
or 'seek' on it.    The descriptor should be in blocking-IO mode.

@item offset
offset to start reading from in the file
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {struct MHD_Response *} MHD_create_response_from_buffer (size_t size, void *data, enum MHD_ResponseMemoryMode mode)
Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
header information and then it can be used any number of times.

@table @var
@item size
size of the data portion of the response;

@item buffer
the data itself;

@item mode
memory management options for buffer; use
MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT if the buffer is static/global memory,
use MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE if the buffer is heap-allocated and
should be freed by MHD and MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY if the
buffer is in transient memory (i.e. on the stack) and must
be copied by MHD;
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {struct MHD_Response *} MHD_create_response_from_data (size_t size, void *data, int must_free, int must_copy)
Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
header information and then it can be used any number of times.
This function is deprecated, use @code{MHD_create_response_from_buffer} instead.

@table @var
@item size
size of the data portion of the response;

@item data
the data itself;

@item must_free
if true: MHD should free data when done;

@item must_copy
if true: MHD allocates a block of memory and use it to make a copy of
@var{data} embedded in the returned @code{MHD_Response} structure;
handling of the embedded memory is responsibility of MHD; @var{data}
can be released anytime after this call returns.
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).
@end deftypefun


Example: create a response from a statically allocated string:

@example
const char * data = "<html><body><p>Error!</p></body></html>";

struct MHD_Connection * connection = ...;
struct MHD_Response *   response;

response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer (strlen(data), data,

@node microhttpd-response headers
@section Adding headers to a response


@deftypefun int MHD_add_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response, const char *header, const char *content)
Add a header line to the response. The strings referenced by
@var{header} and @var{content} must be zero-terminated and they are
duplicated into memory blocks embedded in @var{response}.

Notice that the strings must not hold newlines, carriage returns or tab
chars.

Return @code{MHD_NO} on error (i.e. invalid header or content format or
memory allocation error).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response, const char *footer, const char *content)
Add a footer line to the response. The strings referenced by
@var{footer} and @var{content} must be zero-terminated and they are
duplicated into memory blocks embedded in @var{response}.

Notice that the strings must not hold newlines, carriage returns or tab
chars.  You can add response footers at any time before signalling the
end of the response to MHD (not just before calling 'MHD_queue_response').
Footers are useful for adding cryptographic checksums to the reply or to
signal errors encountered during data generation.  This call was introduced
in MHD 0.9.3.

Return @code{MHD_NO} on error (i.e. invalid header or content format or
memory allocation error).
@end deftypefun



@deftypefun int MHD_del_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response, const char *header, const char *content)
Delete a header (or footer) line from the response.  Return @code{MHD_NO} on error
(arguments are invalid or no such header known).
@end deftypefun

@node microhttpd-response options
@section Setting response options

@table @var
@item response
which response should be modified;

@item flags
flags to set for the response;

@end table

Additional arguments are a list of options (type-value pairs,

Get all of the headers added to a response.

Invoke the @var{iterator} callback for each header in the response,
using @var{iterator_cls} as first argument. Return number of entries
iterated over.  @var{iterator} can be @code{NULL}: in this case the function
just counts headers.

@var{iterator} should not modify the its key and value arguments, unless
we know what we are doing.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {const char *} MHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response *response, const char *key)
Find and return a pointer to the value of a particular header from the

@node microhttpd-flow
@chapter Flow control.

@noindent
Sometimes it may be possible that clients upload data faster
than an application can process it, or that an application
needs an extended period of time to generate a response.
If @code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION} is used, applications
can simply deal with this by performing their logic within the
thread and thus effectively blocking connection processing
by MHD.  In all other modes, blocking logic must not be
placed within the callbacks invoked by MHD as this would also
block processing of other requests, as a single thread may be
responsible for tens of thousands of connections.

Instead, applications using thread modes other than
@code{MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION} should use the
following functions to perform flow control.

@deftypefun int MHD_suspend_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)
Suspend handling of network data for a given connection.  This can
be used to dequeue a connection from MHD's event loop (external
select, internal select or thread pool; not applicable to
thread-per-connection!) for a while.

If you use this API in conjunction with a internal select or a
thread pool, you must set the option @code{MHD_USE_SUSPEND_RESUME} to
ensure that a resumed connection is immediately processed by MHD.

Suspended connections continue to count against the total number of
connections allowed (per daemon, as well as per IP, if such limits
are set).  Suspended connections will NOT time out; timeouts will
restart when the connection handling is resumed.  While a
connection is suspended, MHD will not detect disconnects by the
client.

The only safe time to suspend a connection is from the
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} or from the respective
@code{MHD_ContentReaderCallback} (but in this case the
response object must not be shared among multiple
connections).

Finally, it is an API violation to call @code{MHD_stop_daemon} while
having suspended connections (this will at least create memory and
socket leaks or lead to undefined behavior).  You must explicitly
resume all connections before stopping the daemon.

@table @var
@item connection
the connection to suspend
@end table
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int MHD_resume_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)
Resume handling of network data for suspended connection.  It is safe
to resume a suspended connection at any time.  Calling this function
on a connection that was not previously suspended will result in
undefined behavior.

@table @var
@item connection
the connection to resume
@end table

@node microhttpd-dauth
@chapter Utilizing Authentication

@noindent
MHD support three types of client authentication.

Basic authentication uses a simple authentication method based
on BASE64 algorithm. Username and password are exchanged in clear
between the client and the server, so this method must only be used
for non-sensitive content or when the session is protected with https.
When using basic authentication MHD will have access to the clear
password, possibly allowing to create a chained authentication
toward an external authentication server.

Digest authentication uses a one-way authentication method based
on MD5 hash algorithm. Only the hash will transit over the network,
hence protecting the user password. The nonce will prevent replay
attacks. This method is appropriate for general use, especially
when https is not used to encrypt the session.

Client certificate authentication uses a X.509 certificate from
the client. This is the strongest authentication mechanism but it
requires the use of HTTPS. Client certificate authentication can
be used simultaneously with Basic or Digest Authentication in order
to provide a two levels authentication (like for instance separate
machine and user authentication).  A code example for using
client certificates is presented in the MHD tutorial.

@var{realm} must reference to a zero-terminated string representing the realm.

@var{username} must reference to a zero-terminated string representing the username,
it is usually the returned value from MHD_digest_auth_get_username.

@var{password} must reference to a zero-terminated string representing the password,
most probably it will be the result of a lookup of the username against a local database.

@var{realm} must reference to a zero-terminated string representing the realm.

@var{opaque} must reference to a zero-terminated string representing a value
that gets passed to the client and expected to be passed again to the server
as-is. This value can be a hexadecimal or base64 string.

@var{response} a response structure to specify what shall be presented to the
client with a 401 HTTP status.

@var{signal_stale} a value that signals "stale=true" in the response header to
indicate the invalidity of the nonce and no need to ask for authentication
parameters and only a new nonce gets generated. @code{MHD_YES} to generate a new
nonce, @code{MHD_NO} to ask for authentication parameters.

@cindex POST method

* microhttpd-post api::         Programming interface for the
                                @code{POST} processor.
@end menu


@noindent
MHD provides the post processor API to make it easier for applications to
parse the data of a client's @code{POST} request: the
@code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} will be invoked multiple times to
process data as it arrives; at each invocation a new chunk of data must
be processed. The arguments @var{upload_data} and @var{upload_data_size}
are used to reference the chunk of data.

When @code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback} is invoked for a new connection:
its @code{*@var{con_cls}} argument is set to @code{NULL}. When @code{POST}
data comes in the upload buffer it is @strong{mandatory} to use the
@var{con_cls} to store a reference to per-connection data.  The fact
that the pointer was initially @code{NULL} can be used to detect that
this is a new request.

One method to detect that a new connection was established is
to set @code{*con_cls} to an unused integer:

@example
int
access_handler (void *cls,
                struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                const char *url,
                const char *method, const char *version,
                const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                void **con_cls)
@{
  static int old_connection_marker;
  int new_connection = (NULL == *con_cls);

  if (new_connection)
    @{
      /* new connection with POST */
      *con_cls = &old_connection_marker;
    @}

  ...
@}
@end example

@noindent
In contrast to the previous example, for @code{POST} requests in particular,
it is more common to use the value of @code{*con_cls} to keep track of
actual state used during processing, such as the post processor (or a
struct containing a post processor):

@example
int
access_handler (void *cls,
                struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                const char *url,
                const char *method, const char *version,
                const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                void **con_cls)
@{
  struct MHD_PostProcessor * pp = *con_cls;

  if (pp == NULL)
    @{
      pp = MHD_create_post_processor(connection, ...);
      *con_cls = pp;
      return MHD_YES;
    @}
  if (*upload_data_size)
    @{
      MHD_post_process(pp, upload_data, *upload_data_size);
      *upload_data_size = 0;
      return MHD_YES;
    @}
  else
    @{
      MHD_destroy_post_processor(pp);
      return MHD_queue_response(...);
    @}
@}
@end example

Note that the callback from @code{MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED}
should be used to destroy the post processor.  This cannot be
done inside of the access handler since the connection may not
always terminate normally.

@cindex POST method

@deftypefun {struct MHD_PostProcessor *} MHD_create_post_processor (struct MHD_Connection *connection, size_t buffer_size, MHD_PostDataIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
Create a PostProcessor.  A PostProcessor can be used to (incrementally)
parse the data portion of a @code{POST} request.

@table @var
@item connection
the connection on which the @code{POST} is happening (used to determine
the @code{POST} format);

@item buffer_size
maximum number of bytes to use for internal buffering (used only for the
parsing, specifically the parsing of the keys).  A tiny value (256-1024)
should be sufficient; do @strong{NOT} use a value smaller than 256;
for good performance, use 32k or 64k (i.e. 65536).

@item iterator
iterator to be called with the parsed data; must @strong{NOT} be
@code{NULL};

@item iterator_cls
custom value to be used as first argument to @var{iterator}.
@end table

Return @code{NULL} on error (out of memory, unsupported encoding), otherwise
a PP handle.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_post_process (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp, const char *post_data, size_t post_data_len)
Parse and process @code{POST} data.  Call this function when @code{POST}
data is available (usually during an @code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback})
with the @var{upload_data} and @var{upload_data_size}.  Whenever
possible, this will then cause calls to the
@code{MHD_IncrementalKeyValueIterator}.

@table @var
@item pp
the post processor;

@item post_data
@var{post_data_len} bytes of @code{POST} data;

@item post_data_len
length of @var{post_data}.
@end table

Return @code{MHD_YES} on success, @code{MHD_NO} on error
(out-of-memory, iterator aborted, parse error).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun int MHD_destroy_post_processor (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp)
Release PostProcessor resources.  After this function is being called,
the PostProcessor is guaranteed to no longer call its iterator.  There
is no special call to the iterator to indicate the end of the post processing
stream.  After destroying the PostProcessor, the programmer should
perform any necessary work to complete the processing of the iterator.

Return @code{MHD_YES} if processing completed nicely, @code{MHD_NO}
if there were spurious characters or formatting problems with
the post request.  It is common to ignore the return value
of this function.

Obtain information about the given daemon.  This function
is currently not fully implemented.

@table @var
@item daemon
the daemon about which information is desired;

@item infoType
type of information that is desired

@item ...
additional arguments about the desired information (depending on
infoType)
@end table

Returns a union with the respective member (depending on
infoType) set to the desired information), or @code{NULL}
in case the desired information is not available or
applicable.
@end deftypefun


@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_DaemonInfoType
Values of this enum are used to specify what
information about a daemon is desired.
@table @code
@item MHD_DAEMON_INFO_KEY_SIZE
Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra argument
(of type 'enum MHD_GNUTLS_CipherAlgorithm').  No longer supported,
using this value will cause @code{MHD_get_daemon_info} to return NULL.

@item MHD_DAEMON_INFO_MAC_KEY_SIZE
Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra argument
(of type 'enum MHD_GNUTLS_HashAlgorithm').  No longer supported,
using this value will cause @code{MHD_get_daemon_info} to return NULL.

@item MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD
@cindex listen
Request the file-descriptor number that MHD is using to listen to the
server socket.  This can be useful if no port
was specified and a client needs to learn what port
is actually being used by MHD.
No extra arguments should be passed.

@item MHD_DAEMON_INFO_EPOLL_FD_LINUX_ONLY
@cindex epoll
Request the file-descriptor number that MHD is using for epoll.  If
the build is not supporting epoll, NULL is returned; if we are using a
thread pool or this daemon was not started with
@code{MHD_USE_EPOLL_LINUX_ONLY}, (a pointer to) -1 is returned.  If we are
using @code{MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY} or are in 'external' select mode, the
internal epoll FD is returned.  This function must be used in external
select mode with epoll to obtain the FD to call epoll on.  No extra
arguments should be passed.

@item MHD_DAEMON_INFO_CURRENT_CONNECTIONS
@cindex connection, limiting number of connections
Request the number of current connections handled by the daemon.  No
extra arguments should be passed and a pointer to a @code{union
MHD_DaemonInfo} value is returned, with the @code{num_connections}
member of type @code{unsigned int} set to the number of active
connections.

Note that in multi-threaded or internal-select mode, the real number of current
connections may already be different when @code{MHD_get_daemon_info} returns.
The number of current connections can be used (even in multi-threaded and
internal-select mode) after @code{MHD_quiesce_daemon} to detect whether all
connections have been handled.

@item connection
the connection about which information is desired;

@item infoType

@deftp {Enumeration} MHD_ConnectionInfoType
Values of this enum are used to specify what information about a
connection is desired.

@table @code

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CIPHER_ALGO
What cipher algorithm is being used (HTTPS connections only).
Takes no extra arguments.
@code{NULL} is returned for non-HTTPS connections.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_PROTOCOL,
Takes no extra arguments.   Allows finding out the TLS/SSL protocol used
(HTTPS connections only).
@code{NULL} is returned for non-HTTPS connections.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CLIENT_ADDRESS
Returns information about the address of the client.  Returns
essentially a @code{struct sockaddr **} (since the API returns
a @code{union MHD_ConnectionInfo *} and that union contains
a @code{struct sockaddr *}).

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_SESSION,
Takes no extra arguments.  Allows access to the underlying GNUtls session,
including access to the underlying GNUtls client certificate
(HTTPS connections only).  Takes no extra arguments.
@code{NULL} is returned for non-HTTPS connections.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_CLIENT_CERT,
Dysfunctional (never implemented, deprecated).  Use
MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_GNUTLS_SESSION to get the @code{gnutls_session_t}
and then call @code{gnutls_certificate_get_peers()}.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_DAEMON
Returns information about @code{struct MHD_Daemon} which manages
this connection.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_FD
Returns the file descriptor (usually a TCP socket) associated with
this connection (in the ``connect-fd'' member of the returned struct).
Note that manipulating the descriptor directly can have problematic
consequences (as in, break HTTP).  Applications might use this access
to manipulate TCP options, for example to set the ``TCP-NODELAY''
option for COMET-like applications.  Note that MHD will set TCP-CORK
after sending the HTTP header and clear it after finishing the footers
automatically (if the platform supports it).  As the connection
callbacks are invoked in between, those might be used to set different
values for TCP-CORK and TCP-NODELAY in the meantime.

@item MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT
Returns the client-specific pointer to a @code{void *} that was
(possibly) set during a @code{MHD_NotifyConnectionCallback} when the
socket was first accepted.  Note that this is NOT the same as the
@code{con_cls} argument of the @code{MHD_AccessHandlerCallback}.  The
@code{con_cls} is fresh for each HTTP request, while the
@code{socket_context} is fresh for each socket.
